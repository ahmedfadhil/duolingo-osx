The unofficial Duolingo application will only run if it's in your Applications folder. 

If you're not a Mac user the source code is included so you can use [WebDGap](http://webdgap.sourceforge.net/) to convert Duolingo for your OS of choice! However if you plan on integrating audio support please read [this post](https://github.com/mikethedj4/duolingo-osx/issues/1). 

**FAQ**:  
This unofficial build of Duolingo for Mac was created using [FluidApp](http://fluidapp.com/) which means that You **MUST** be using a 64bit Mac running OS X 10.7 or later.
